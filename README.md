**What's going on?**

The idea of this task is to make some tests, for example, searching flights and check results (or no results) using:

- CucumberJS (BDD)
- Protractor JS (considering front-end app is made with AngularJS)
- TypeScript (precompiled JS)
- Gulp (build)


**How to install**

Prerequisites:

- Have NodeJS installed

- Chromedriver on root folder (in my case I'm using [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) for MacOS )

```
npm install
```

**How to run tests**

Prerequisites:

- Execute previous command

```
gulp
```
